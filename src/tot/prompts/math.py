Input: Solve \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\)
Possible next steps: 
I can factorize \(x^2 - 5x + 6\) into \((x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\)
I can use the quadratic formula: \(x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)}\)
I can complete the square by rewriting \(x^2 - 5x = -6\)
I can use the rational root theorem to find the roots of the polynomial
Input: Simplify \(\frac{2x + 4}{x + 2}\)
Possible next steps:
I can factor out a 2 from the numerator to get \(2(x + 2)\)
I can rewrite the fraction as \(\frac{2x}{x+2} + \frac{4}{x + 2}\)
I can use long division to simplify the fraction
Input: Solve \(2x + 5 > 3x - 1\)
Possible next steps:
I can subtract \(2x\) from both sides to get \(5 > x - 1\)
I can subtract \(3x\) from both sides: \(2x - 3x + 5 > -1\)
I can rearrange the equation to \(2x - 3x > -1 - 5\)

value_prompt = r'''Evluate if this line of reasoning is correct (sure/likely/impossible)
If \(x^2 = 4\), then \(x = 2\)
The equation \(x^2 = 4\) has two solutions: \(x = 2\) and \(x = -2\)
The reasoning only considers one solution, so it is incomplete but not entirely wrong
likely
To find the derivative of \(x^3\), we use the power rule and get \(3x^2\)
The power rule for derivatives states \( \frac{d}{dx} [x^n] = nx^{n-1} \)
Applying this to \(x^3\), we get \(3x^2\), which is correct
sure
The integral of \(e^x\) with respect to \(x\) is \(e^x + C\)
The integral of \(e^x\) is a well-known result and evaluates to \(e^x + C\), where \(C\) is the constant of integration
This reasoning is accurate and complete
sure
The equation \(x + 2 = x + 3\) has infinitely many solutions
Subtract \(x\) from both sides: \(2 = 3\), which is clearly false.
The reasoning is fundamentally incorrect since no solution exists, let alone infinitely many
impossible
